# Error `You must be creator, or administrator`

In case the user connects the channel to the Telepost through the bot [{{ telepost.bot.name }}]({{ telepost.bot.url }}), and after that the user leaves the channel or stops being admin / owner in it then when trying to connect such a channel, the error `You must be creator, or administrator` will appear in the Web UI:

## Solution

The user who connected the channel through the bot [{{ telepost.bot.name }}]({{ telepost.bot.url }}) needs to become an admin / owner in the channel again.

It is also recommended to use your own custom bot, how to connect it - read in [this manual](../start/personal-bot-for-telepost.mdx).
